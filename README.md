# PyLeetCode
- This repo is a curation of the [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) Problems which I solve occasionaly.
- The solutions are primarily in Python
- You can use this as a refernce for your Interview Prep Journey or in general problem solving
- Currently availabe:Easy Problems

# Note:
- I have tried to obtain the best solutions for each of the problems
- Yet there might be ones which are much more efficent in terms of space and time complexity or even brevity of code
- Feel free to add your own!

# Problems:

| Questions | Solution |

## Further work:
- Complete all Easy Problems
