# PyLeetCode üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
- This repo is a curation of the [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) Problems which I solve occasionaly.
- The solutions are primarily in Python
- You can use this as a refernce for your Interview Prep Journey or in general problem solving
- Currently availabe:Easy Problems

# Note:
- I have tried to obtain the best solutions for each of the problems
- Yet there might be ones which are much more efficent in terms of space and time complexity or even brevity of code
- Feel free to add your own!

# Disclaimer: ‚ùó
- I don't own or am the creator of any of the problems.
- Please refer to the official [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) website for any futher details

## Further work:
- Complete all Easy Problems
- Have detailed explanations along with the code
- Do time and spacy complexity analysis of each
- Start implementing Medium Problems

# Other places to practice from(Scripts coming up post summer):

- HackerRank
- GeeksforGeeks
- Project Euler
- CodeChef

# Challenge! ‚öî
- If you dare then take up the #100DaysofCode Challenge on Twitter and solve 4-5 problems everyday!
- Believe me in no time, you would have solved all the Easy problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
